One of my personal projects was redesigning Cyphers abilities and the sounds of the Vandal Rifle, from Riot Games' Tactical Shooter VALORANT.
I used the ablities and the rifle as a canvas to work on my sample manipulation and synthesis work within the free "Helm" synthesizer by Matt Tytel.

Additionally a video walkthrough, as well as my written walkthrough of this redesign can be found <a href="/writeups/cypher-design-writeup"> here <a/>, including pictures of the abilities being redesigned, Logic Pro X Project file, and Helm patches being used.
