One of my personal projects was redesigning Cyphers abilities and the sounds of the Vandal Rifle, from Riot Games' Tactical Shooter VALORANT.
I used the ablities and the rifle as a canvas to work on my sample manipulation and synthesis work within the free "Helm" synthesizer by Matt Tytel.

Here I do a quick walk and listen through my final project file for the redesign. I also talk about my thought process behind certain decisions for ablities and my ideas for how it should all sound.

Additionally my written walkthrough of this redesign can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X4P_k-eWFvxTlwSyYkSfqDSHVL4gRprytMOkhu6AP4w/edit?usp=sharing"> here <a/>, including pictures of the abilities being redesigned, Logic Pro X Project file, and Helm patches being used.
